{"name":"we should have four type of inventories for Merchant, new product inventory, returned product inventory, scraped product inventory, and refurbished product inventory. And all these inventories should belong to Merchant. for returned product, if it is in original box/condition, the product should be put back to new product inventory, otherwise, it should be placed in returned product inventory. If it is not worth to repair, we scrap the product. If it is repairable, we order parts then get it fixed to put into refurbished inventory for sale.  for RMA caused by carrier or Toolots, the cost of the product should be reimbursed to Merchant at FOB price. For RMA caused by product quality or package issue, Merchant has to take full responsibility and pay all the costs occurred.  It should be easy to calculate the cost, the payment and inventory. Also, you just need to look at each step to see which operation needs to be done by which user and which info needs to be provided to which user and which status needs to be changed.","id":17303,"work":1,"_t":1602813452523}
